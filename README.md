# Gas-Leakage-Detection-and-Gas-volume-measurement-system

This project aims to develop a gas leakage detection and gas level monitoring system that ensures user safety by detecting gas leaks and notifying the user through an activated buzzer and SMS alerts. Additionally, the system measures the amount of gas in the gas cylinder and sends an SMS to the user when the gas level is low.

# Features
1. Gas leakage detection: The system utilizes gas sensors to detect the presence of gas leaks in the environment.
2. Buzzer activation: When a gas leak is detected, an onboard buzzer is activated to provide an audible alert.
3. SMS alerts: The system is equipped with an SMS module that sends immediate alerts to the user's mobile phone when a gas leak is detected.
4. Gas level monitoring: The system measures the gas level inside the gas cylinder to provide real-time information to the user.
5. Low gas level alert: When the gas level in the cylinder becomes low, an SMS notification is sent to the user, indicating the need for a gas cylinder replacement or refill.
6. User-friendly interface: The system provides an intuitive interface for easy interaction and monitoring of gas leakage and gas levels.
7. Cost-effective design: The system is designed to be cost-effective, making it accessible for a wide range of users.
